## 3 Goals for 2025/2026 School Year
### Submissive and Hirable
Get a job in the field or get fully promoted to supervisor.
#### Costco Optimization
- Integrate and program templates in Google Sheets for making quick plans
- Get a thermal printer and use a raspberry pi or Arduino to print out plans and tags
- Setup Templates in PowerBI for quick reports and optimization.

#### Long-Term Career Goals for 6-9 months
- Build home server
- Build and operate kubernetes cluster 
- Get the [[Network+ Notes|Network +]] certification
- Get the [[CCNA|Cisco Network Certification]]
- Make Youtube videos documenting the process of getting to the cheese
- Learn [[Ansible]] and [[TerraForm]] to automate VM Deployment
- [[AWS Cloud Practitioner]] and/or [[Security+]] 
- Add monitoring or logging to the server (Graylog, elk, splunk)
- Setup server mock enterprise (Users, fileshares w/perms, patching)
### Become Internet Parental Disappointment :D
- Get to 10k subscribers
- See [[Video Project Ideas]] 

I think this is by far the most abstract of the goals on this list. I dont yet know if making a new project a week or doing livestreams is the best way to go about it. I think in general the best way is to make long-form content and then splitting it down into shorts for tiktok and youtube shorts. In general making videos on the projects made i think will be the best balance for all of my goals.

2. Take 3 classes in spring if possible
